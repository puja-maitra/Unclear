# BASICS OF COMPUTER VISION WITH OPENCV

April 3rd - 11th

Learnt the basics of computer vision like launching the webcam from within a python program, tracking objects of a certain colour, image thresholds, resizing images, blurring images, translation and rotation of images etc. among a lot of other things.

The files uploaded with prefix Week1_ are some of the applications of OpenCV that I have done.
