# WEEK 2 & 3 : LEARNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF BASIC MACHINE LEARNING CONCEPTS
April 12th - 30th

Week 2 was mostly used to learn about the concepts of ML like datasets, training examples, validation sets, optimization, overfitting, minimizing losses and a rough idea of how machine learning works.

Week 3 onwards was used to learn how to create these machine learning models using tensorflow. Applications of machine learning in that week had more to do with image classification - binary classification model for distinguishing dogs and cats, flower classification depending on their type and digit recognition. CNNs were used.

The digit recognition model was part of the assignment which used a kaggle dataset containing different handwritten digits and the model was to classify them accordingly.  The model reached about 98% accuracy using a validation set.
