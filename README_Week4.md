# WEEK 4 : GANs

May 20th - June 1st

The week was used to learn about ResNet architectures and GANs. ResNet architecture is used to solve the problem of exploding or vanishing gradients. It involves "residual blocks". GANs or Generative Adversarial Networks are used to generate new, but fake, data, similar to the training examples given. The closer to the real training examples the generated examples are, the better the network. GANs and ResNet formed an important part of the final project code, i.e., for super resolution of images.

The assignment for this part of the project was to implement a model which could auto-color a given sketch. (As the training was very slow, I did not go beyond 10 epochs in this assignment.)
